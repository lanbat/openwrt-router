# openwrt-extra-networks

Manage isolated WiFi networks on OpenWrt — IoT, guest, untrusted — with a single parameterized install script. Each network gets its own subnet, firewall zone, DNS policy, and rate limit, plus optional push-notified join approval, per-device outbound access control, scheduled access windows, password rotation, and a live web dashboard — deployed in seconds, no LuCI needed.

Built for households that need more than one level of trust: your own devices, IoT gadgets that shouldn't touch anything, and guests who just need internet.

Works with OpenWrt `fw4` / nftables.

## Networks

| Network | Purpose | DNS | Rate | Allowlist |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `untrusted` | IoT / misbehaving devices | 1.1.1.3 filtered | 500kbit shared | MAC-based — unlisted devices get nothing |
| `guest` | Visitors | 1.1.1.3 filtered | 10mbit shared / 5mbit per device | none — open to any device |

Each network is a config file. Add a new one by copying an example.

## Features

- **One script, any network** — `sh install.sh configs/guest.conf` deploys a complete isolated network
- **Strict firewall isolation** — each network can reach the internet and nothing else by default
- **WiFi client isolation** — devices on the same network can't reach each other
- **Filtered DNS** — Cloudflare for Families (1.1.1.3) blocks malware and adult content
- **DNS bypass prevention** — port 53 to any unauthorised server is blocked at the firewall
- **Encrypted DNS (DoT)** — optionally route DNS through `https-dns-proxy` for encrypted queries
- **Rate limiting** — aggregate cap + optional per-device cap via nftables; no kernel modules required
- **Port restriction** — limit outbound ports (e.g. web-only guests)
- **MAC allowlist** — for IoT networks: unlisted devices get no lease and are blocked from forwarding
- **Join approval** — optionally block all new devices from internet access until you approve them; a push notification fires with an **Approve** button the moment they connect; approvals persist across reboots and are reset when the password is rotated
- **Per-device control** — when enabled, each approved device must explicitly allow every outbound domain or IP it tries to reach; blocked attempts accumulate on a per-device management page; approved rules persist across reboots
- **LAN ↔ isolated access** — optionally let LAN devices reach isolated network devices (`LAN_ACCESS=yes`); separately, isolated devices that try to reach LAN services trigger a push notification with an **Approve** button so you can grant temporary per-service access
- **mDNS reflection** — let guests discover shared services (Chromecast, AirPrint) via avahi
- **Push notifications** — event-driven alerts via ntfy.sh: new device joined, join approved/denied/revoked, LAN access request/approval/expiry, allowlist rejection, bandwidth alert, port forwarded/removed, password rotated, daily digest, VPN state change, router reboot
- **Live status dashboard** — web page on the router showing all networks, connected devices with per-device traffic (IPv4 and IPv6), VPN status, WireGuard server peers, pending LAN access requests, active LAN access rules, and port forwards
- **Traffic counters** — bytes in/out per network since last firewall reload, shown in status
- **Access schedule** — restrict internet to specific hours; auto-blocked outside the window
- **Temporary port forwarding** — expose a LAN host to guests for a fixed time; auto-removed via cron
- **Password rotation** — generate a new key, apply it live, disconnect old clients, and print a fresh QR code
- **Guest info page** — LAN-accessible HTML page with SSID, password, and QR code
- **WPA3 support** — `sae` for WPA3-only, `sae-mixed` for WPA3+WPA2, `psk+psk2` for legacy
- **Dual-band** — broadcast the same network on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios
- **IPv6** — optional DHCPv6 + RA with auto-derived IPv6 DNS; IPv6 addresses supported throughout (device table, approval flow, firewall rules)
- **No secrets in the repo** — WiFi keys live only in gitignored config files on the router
- **Idempotent installs** — re-running `install.sh` updates an existing network cleanly

## Setup

### 1. Clone onto your router

```sh
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/lanbat/openwrt-extra-networks.git
cd openwrt-extra-networks
```

### 2. Create a config

```sh
cp configs/guest.conf.example configs/guest.conf
vi configs/guest.conf   # set WIFI_KEY, SSID, and anything else
```

### 3. Install

```sh
sh install.sh configs/guest.conf
```

Repeat for each network you want.

## Configuration

Config files live in `configs/` and are gitignored — they never leave the router. Copy an example, fill in `WIFI_KEY`, adjust anything else.

### Required

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `WIFI_KEY` | WiFi password (min 8 chars) |
| `IFACE` | UCI interface name — must be unique (e.g. `guest`, `untrusted`) |
| `SSID` | WiFi network name |
| `SUBNET` | First three octets — router gets `.1`, clients `.100`–`.249` (e.g. `192.168.3`) |

### Wireless

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RADIO` | `radio0` | `radio0` = 2.4GHz, `radio1` = 5GHz |
| `RADIO_EXTRA` | — | Second radio for dual-band (e.g. `radio1`); leave blank for single-band |
| `ENCRYPTION` | `psk2+psk3` | `sae` = WPA3 only, `sae-mixed` = WPA3+WPA2, `psk+psk2` = WPA2+WPA |
| `ISOLATE` | `yes` | Prevent clients on the same network from reaching each other |

### Network

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RATE_LIMIT` | `0` | Aggregate bandwidth cap — `10mbit`, `500kbit`, `0` to disable |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_DEVICE` | `0` | Per-device cap; both limits apply simultaneously when set |
| `DNS_SERVER` | `1.1.1.3` | DNS given to clients — `1.1.1.3` filtered, `1.1.1.1` plain |
| `DOT` | `no` | Route DNS through `https-dns-proxy` for encrypted DoT/DoH; requires it to be installed and configured |
| `IPV6` | `no` | Enable IPv6 (DHCPv6 + RA); IPv6 DNS auto-derived from `DNS_SERVER` for Cloudflare and Google addresses; set `DNS_SERVER_V6` explicitly for any other resolver |
| `DNS_SERVER_V6` | auto | IPv6 DNS server handed to clients via DHCPv6; derived automatically from `DNS_SERVER` when possible; without it the IPv6 DNS bypass-prevention rule is not created |
| `ALLOWED_PORTS` | — | Restrict outbound TCP/UDP ports, e.g. `"80 443"`; NTP (123) always allowed |

### Access and isolation

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LAN_ACCESS` | `no` | Allow LAN devices to initiate connections to this network (not vice versa) |
| `ALLOWLIST` | `no` | MAC allowlist — only listed devices get a lease or can forward traffic |
| `VLAN_ID` | — | 802.1Q VLAN ID — bridge a tagged wired port into this network alongside WiFi, e.g. `20` |
| `VLAN_TRUNK` | — | Physical interface carrying the VLAN trunk, e.g. `eth0` — required when `VLAN_ID` is set |
| `MDNS` | `no` | Reflect mDNS between LAN and this network; installs avahi-daemon if absent |
| `NOTIFY_URL` | — | ntfy.sh URL for push notifications, e.g. `https://ntfy.sh/my-topic` |
| `NOTIFY_JOIN` | `no` | Send a push notification each time a device gets a DHCP lease |
| `JOIN_APPROVAL` | `no` | Block internet for new devices until you approve them via push notification (requires `NOTIFY_URL`) |
| `JOIN_HISTORY_RETENTION` | `90d` | Keep join approval, denial, and revocation history this long; plain numbers mean days |
| `DEVICE_CONTROL` | `no` | Per-device outbound control — each approved device must explicitly allow every destination domain or IP it tries to reach; requires `JOIN_APPROVAL=yes`; see [Per-device control](#per-device-control) |
| `DEFAULT_DURATION` | `24h` | Pre-selected duration in the LAN access approval form (`1h` `6h` `12h` `24h` `2d` `7d` `30d`) |
| `MAX_DURATION` | `30d` | Longest duration available in the LAN access approval form — options above this are hidden |
| `REASON_REQUIRED` | `no` | `yes` — approver must enter a reason before LAN access is granted |
| `BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD_MB` | `0` | Alert when a device transfers this many MB in a session; `0` to disable |
| `SHOW_QR` | `no` | Show WiFi QR code and password in the status dashboard; ignored for the `untrusted` network |
| `ROTATE_PASSWORD` | `no` | Show a manual "Rotate password" button in the status dashboard |
| `DESCRIPTION` | — | Label shown in the status dashboard header for this network |

> `ACCESS_HOURS` appears in the example config files as a reminder that a schedule can be set, but `install.sh` does not read it — the line is inert. Use `tools/access-schedule.sh` to set or remove the schedule.

## Allowlist

When `ALLOWLIST=yes`, only devices listed in `/etc/${IFACE}-allowed-macs` can get a DHCP lease or forward traffic.

Format — one device per line:

```
# mac  ip  description
aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff  192.168.2.100  Nest Protect Living Room
11:22:33:44:55:66  192.168.2.101  Nest Protect Bedroom
```

The file lives at `/etc/extra-networks/${IFACE}-allowed-macs`. After editing, apply without restarting:

```sh
ACTION=ifup INTERFACE=untrusted sh /etc/hotplug.d/iface/51-untrusted-macfilter
```

Two-layer enforcement:
1. **DHCP** — dnsmasq ignores DHCP requests from unlisted MACs
2. **nftables** — forwarding from unlisted IPs is dropped even with a manual static IP

## Encrypted DNS (DoT)

When `DOT=yes`, clients are given the router's own IP as their DNS server. Queries go to dnsmasq, which forwards them to `https-dns-proxy` over DoH/DoT — encrypted all the way to the resolver.

External DNS is blocked at the firewall: port 53 to any external server is rejected, and port 853 (DoT bypass) is also blocked. Clients cannot escape.

Requires `https-dns-proxy` to be installed and configured on the router. On this setup it resolves via Mullvad and Quad9.

## mDNS reflection

mDNS multicast packets are confined to a single subnet — a guest on `192.168.3.x` can't discover a Chromecast on `192.168.1.x` because the broadcast stops at the router.

`MDNS=yes` installs and configures `avahi-daemon` to relay mDNS packets between LAN and the isolated network. Guests can then discover and use shared services: Chromecast, AirPrint, game lobbies.

**Note:** avahi reflects all mDNS services, not just specific ones. Guests would see printers, file shares, and other LAN devices that advertise via mDNS. Use `MDNS=yes` only on networks where that level of sharing is intentional.

## Device notifications

Set `NOTIFY_URL` to an [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) topic URL. Subscribe in the ntfy app on your phone. Each network can have its own topic.

```sh
NOTIFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/my-unique-topic-name
```

All notifications include a link to the status dashboard. LAN access requests include an **Approve** action button.

| Event | Trigger | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| New device joined | Device gets a DHCP lease (when `NOTIFY_JOIN=yes`) | Low |
| Join request | New device needs internet approval (when `JOIN_APPROVAL=yes`) | Default |
| Join approved | Device internet access approved via web form | Default |
| Join denied | Device internet access denied via web form | Default |
| Access revoked | Previously approved device's internet access revoked via device page | Default |
| Device removed | Device fully removed from the network via device page | Default |
| Rule added | Domain or IP allow rule added for a device (when `DEVICE_CONTROL=yes`) | Default |
| LAN access request | Isolated device blocked from reaching a LAN service | Default |
| LAN access approved | Access granted via web form or `allow-service.sh` | Default |
| LAN access expired | Temporary rule removed by cron | Low |
| Allowlist rejection | Unlisted device attempts to use the network | High |
| Bandwidth alert | Device exceeds `BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD_MB` in a session | Default |
| Port forwarded | `expose-port.sh` adds a redirect | Default |
| Port forward removed | Rule expired or `unexpose-port.sh` called | Low |
| Password rotated | `rotate-password.sh` generates a new key | Default |
| Daily digest | System health, VPN/routing set status, WG peers, traffic, blocked counts, expiring rules, calendar | Low |
| Router reboot | Router comes back online (30s delay) | Low |
| VPN state change | VPN goes down or recovers | High / Default |

### LAN access approval

When an isolated device tries to reach a service on your LAN (192.168.1.x or its IPv6 equivalent), nftables logs the new connection and `check-access-log.sh` (runs every minute via cron) detects it and fires a push notification with an **Approve** button. Tapping it opens a form on the router showing the requesting device's IP, MAC, and hostname alongside the LAN destination. You pick how long to allow access, optionally enter a reason, and submit — the rule is added immediately and removed automatically when it expires. A confirmation push is sent with both devices' IP, MAC, and hostname.

`DEFAULT_DURATION` pre-selects a duration in the form (default `24h`). `MAX_DURATION` hides longer options. Set `REASON_REQUIRED=yes` to make the reason field mandatory — enforced both client-side and server-side.

The approval page (`/cgi-bin/approve-access`) is only reachable from your home LAN — isolated zones have `INPUT=REJECT`. Both IPv4 and IPv6 source/destination addresses are supported in the approval flow.

### Join approval

When `JOIN_APPROVAL=yes`, every device that connects to the network is initially **blocked from internet access** until you approve it. This lets you control exactly which devices can use the network even if they know the WiFi password.

How it works:

1. Device connects and gets a DHCP lease → its IP is added to an nftables block set; internet traffic is dropped immediately
2. A push notification fires: *"unknown (aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff) joined guest at 192.168.3.105 and needs internet approval"* with an **Approve** button
3. Tap **Approve** → opens `/cgi-bin/approve-join` showing the device's hostname, IP, and MAC — two buttons: **Approve internet access** or **Deny internet access**
4. Approving records the device's MAC in `/etc/extra-networks/${IFACE}-join-approved` and unblocks it immediately
5. On all future joins (same MAC, any IP) the device passes straight through with no notification

The dashboard shows join state in the connected-device table: pending, approved, or denied. Denied devices stay blocked and can be approved later from the same row. Approval, denial, and revocation all send a push notification naming the device (IP, DNS, hostname, MAC) and the LAN client that made the decision.

Join decisions are also written to `/etc/extra-networks/${IFACE}-join-history` and shown on the dashboard. `JOIN_HISTORY_RETENTION` controls how long entries are kept; the default is `90d`. The installer adds `/etc/extra-networks` to `sysupgrade.conf` so history survives reboots and normal OpenWrt sysupgrades.

When the WiFi password is rotated, labeled approved devices stay approved; unlabeled approvals, pending requests, and denied requests are cleared because those devices must reconnect with the new password.

The block set is rebuilt from the pending state file on `fw4 reload` and reboot, so blocked devices stay blocked across restarts until explicitly approved.

### Per-device control

`DEVICE_CONTROL=yes` places each approved device under its own nftables inspect chain. All new outbound connections are **blocked by default** and logged. The device can only reach destinations you've explicitly approved — by domain or by IP. Best suited for IoT devices that should only contact known servers.

Requires `JOIN_APPROVAL=yes` — the approval step records each device's IP, which the inspect chain needs to generate per-device rules. Set both in the config file and re-run `install.sh`.

**Approving connections**

When a device's outbound connection is blocked, it appears in the **Pending connections** table on that device's page. Open the page by clicking the device's MAC address in the status dashboard:

1. Find the device in the dashboard's network table
2. Click its MAC address link → opens `/cgi-bin/device?net=<iface>&mac=<mac>`
3. The **Pending connections** table lists each blocked destination (IP, port, protocol, reverse DNS)
4. Click **Allow** to permit that destination, or **Deny** to dismiss it without approving

Use **Approve domain** to allow a hostname: the router adds a dnsmasq `nftset=` rule so all IPs that domain resolves to are automatically allowed for this device going forward.

Approved rules are written to `/etc/extra-networks/<iface>-device-rules` and survive reboots. Domains are written to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/<iface>-device-<mac>.conf`.

**Device page**

Every device with a label has a dedicated management page — not just DEVICE_CONTROL networks. Click any MAC address in the status dashboard to open it.

| Section | Available when | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Device | Always | MAC, tracked IPv4/IPv6, network, DNS name, join approval state and actions |
| Connection rate limit | Always | New-connection cap per minute (default 120); configurable per device |
| Approve domain | `DEVICE_CONTROL=yes` | Add a hostname allow rule |
| Pending connections | `DEVICE_CONTROL=yes` | Blocked outbound attempts — Allow / Deny each |
| Rules | `DEVICE_CONTROL=yes` | Active domain and IP allow rules — revoke individually |
| History | Always | Last 20 join decisions (approve/deny/revoke) for this device, with timestamp, IP, and approver |
| Approval activity | Always | Join decisions where this device was the approver on another device |
| Danger zone | Always | Remove device — deletes label, rules, approval, and DNS entry; takes effect immediately |

**Connection rate limit**

Every device's new-connection rate is capped to prevent port scans and misbehaving apps from flooding the network. The default is 120 new connections/minute. Adjust it per device on the device page — takes effect immediately without reloading the firewall. The limit applies whether or not `DEVICE_CONTROL` is enabled.

**Per-device DNS names**

When a device is labeled — either at approval time or later via the device page — its label is slugified and registered in dnsmasq. A device labeled "Alice's Phone" becomes reachable at `alices-phone.lan` from the rest of the LAN. The DNS entry is written to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/<iface>-dns-<mac>.conf` and survives reboots. Re-labeling a device updates the entry immediately.

### Bandwidth alerts

`BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD_MB` triggers an alert when a device exceeds that many MB in a session. Counters reset on `fw4 reload` or after 24 hours of inactivity. An IP is only alerted once per session.

### Daily digest

Sent every morning at 08:00. Includes:

- **System health** — uptime, 1-min load average, memory usage %
- **VPN status** — up/down per tier (if split-routing is configured)
- **Routing set sizes** — entry count for each nft set, and how long ago the blocklists were last refreshed
- **WireGuard server peers** — how many peers were active in the last 24h (for server-mode WG interfaces)
- **Traffic** — ↓/↑ totals, connected device count (active DHCP leases), active LAN access rule count per network
- **Blocked counts** — LAN access requests and allowlist rejections logged since boot
- **Expiring rules** — any temporary LAN access rules expiring today or tomorrow
- **Calendar events** — upcoming events for the next 7 days (if `GCAL_URL` is configured)

To enable calendar integration, set in `/etc/extra-networks/config`:

```sh
GCAL_URL=https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/<your-calendar-id>/basic.ics
GCAL_TZ_OFFSET=1   # hours offset from UTC for time display
```

Recurring events (weekly, biweekly) are expanded correctly — the ICS start date is no barrier.

### Including the main LAN in the digest

The digest covers every network that has a `*-notify.conf` file in `/etc/extra-networks/`. Isolated networks get one automatically from `install.sh`. The main LAN does not, so create it manually:

```sh
cat >/etc/extra-networks/lan-notify.conf <<EOF
NOTIFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/your-topic
SUBNET=192.168.1
IFACE_NAME=lan
EOF
```

Traffic reporting also requires a counter chain, which `install.sh` now creates automatically at `/etc/nftables.d/24-lan-counter.nft` on every run. If you're adding the main LAN before running `install.sh` again, create it manually and reload:

```sh
cat >/etc/nftables.d/24-lan-counter.nft <<'EOF'
chain lan_counter {
    type filter hook forward priority 0; policy accept;
    iifname "br-lan" counter
    oifname "br-lan" counter
}
EOF
fw4 reload
```

Device count reflects active DHCP leases matching the `SUBNET` prefix. Devices with static IPs that never request a lease are not counted.

### WAN monitoring

WAN connectivity is checked every 5 minutes by pinging `1.1.1.1` and `8.8.8.8`. When WAN goes down there is no alert (no internet to send it), but the outage start time is recorded locally. When connectivity is restored a notification is sent with the outage duration.

### VPN monitoring

If `/etc/split-routing/` is present, each VPN tier (`vpn-*.conf`) is monitored independently every 5 minutes. A high-priority alert fires when a tier goes down; a default-priority alert fires when it recovers. State is persisted in `/etc/extra-networks/vpn-state-<iface>` so only transitions trigger alerts. Uses the `NOTIFY_URL` from the first configured extra-networks network.

### WireGuard VPN server peers

The status dashboard automatically detects WireGuard interfaces configured in server mode (those where no peer has an `endpoint_host` set in UCI). For each such interface, a table appears showing only currently connected peers — those with a handshake within the last 3 minutes. Each row includes:

- **Online** — ● if a handshake occurred within the last 3 minutes, ○ otherwise
- **Description** — the peer's description from LuCI (`network.@wireguard_<iface>[N].description`)
- **Endpoint** — the peer's public IP address
- **Last handshake** — time since last handshake (seconds, minutes, hours, or days ago); `—` if never connected
- **Traffic** — bytes received / sent since the last `wg` counter reset

All configured peers are shown regardless of connection state. No configuration is required: the dashboard reads this directly from `wg show` output and UCI.

## Status dashboard

When `NOTIFY_URL` is set, a live web dashboard is installed at:

```
http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/status
```

The page auto-refreshes every 60 seconds and shows:

- **System** — uptime, memory, load, WAN IPv4/IPv6
- **VPN** — interface and state (up / down / routing fault)
- **WireGuard server peers** — auto-detected for any WireGuard interface in server mode (no outbound peers); shows all configured peers with an online indicator (● / ○), endpoint IP, last handshake, and bytes transferred
- **Networks** — state, subnet, traffic (↓/↑), connected devices with hostname, IP, MAC, join approval state, recent join decision history, and per-device traffic. An IPv6 column appears automatically when the network has IPv6 configured or clients have IPv6 addresses.
- **Pending LAN access** — blocked isolated→LAN connection attempts logged since the last check, with **Approve** buttons linking directly to the approval form
- **Active LAN access** — temporary allowances in both directions (LAN→isolated and isolated→LAN) with destination, port, protocol, and time remaining
- **Port forwards** — active redirects with zone, port, destination, and expiry
- **Recent blocked** — last 10 blocked forwarding attempts from allowlist-restricted networks (`ALLOWLIST=yes`), showing time, source device, destination, and port/proto
- **WiFi QR codes** — SSID, password, and scannable QR code per network (when `SHOW_QR=yes`)

Only reachable from LAN — isolated zones have `INPUT=REJECT`.

## VLAN trunk

Set `VLAN_ID` and `VLAN_TRUNK` to bridge a tagged wired port into the network alongside the WiFi SSID. Devices on that VLAN from a managed switch land on the same L2 segment as WiFi clients — same subnet, same firewall rules, same DHCP pool.

```sh
VLAN_ID=20       # tag used on the switch trunk port
VLAN_TRUNK=eth0  # physical interface the trunk arrives on (hardware-specific)
```

The trunk interface name depends on your board — check with `ip link show`. Common values: `eth0`, `eth1`, `lan1`. `install.sh` creates an `8021q` VLAN device (`eth0.20`) and adds it to `br-${IFACE}`; netifd brings it up automatically.

Omit both variables (or leave them blank) for WiFi-only — the feature is entirely opt-in.

## Tools

### Status

```sh
sh tools/status.sh
```

CLI summary of all isolated networks: bridge IP and state, WiFi SSID and encryption, connected clients, DHCP leases, rate limits, traffic counters, access schedule state, port forwards, and LAN access status.

When `NOTIFY_URL` is set, a web dashboard is also available at `http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/status` — see [Status dashboard](#status-dashboard).

### Uninstall

```sh
sh tools/uninstall.sh configs/guest.conf
sh tools/uninstall.sh configs/untrusted.conf --purge   # also removes allowed-macs file
```

Removes all UCI sections, nftables files, hotplug scripts, cron entries, and the generated web page for the network.

### QR code

```sh
sh tools/qr.sh configs/guest.conf
```

Prints the WiFi credentials as a QR code in the terminal. Requires `qrencode` (`apk add qrencode`).

### Access schedule

Restrict internet access to specific hours. Enforced via nftables — all forwarding is dropped outside the window. Schedule survives reboots via cron.

```sh
# Restrict guest internet to 8am–11pm
sh tools/access-schedule.sh configs/guest.conf 8-23

# Remove schedule (always on)
sh tools/access-schedule.sh configs/guest.conf always

# Show current schedule and state
sh tools/access-schedule.sh configs/guest.conf status

# Force internet off right now, regardless of schedule
sh tools/access-schedule.sh configs/guest.conf block

# Re-enable internet right now, regardless of schedule
sh tools/access-schedule.sh configs/guest.conf unblock
```

`block` and `unblock` are one-off manual overrides — they don't modify the schedule. The next scheduled transition will resume normal operation.

### Temporary LAN access

The tool works in both directions and supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

**Isolated → LAN** (the primary use case): when a guest or IoT device tries to reach a LAN service, a push notification fires with an **Approve** button. The web form shows the requesting device (IP, MAC, hostname) and the target service. Submit to add a temporary firewall rule for that specific device + port combination.

**LAN → isolated**: allow a LAN device to reach a specific isolated device — for example, to SSH into a guest VM.

You can also grant or revoke access directly from the command line:

```sh
# Allow a guest device to reach a LAN service (isolated → LAN)
sh tools/allow-service.sh guest 192.168.1.100 tcp 443 24h lan

# Allow a LAN device to reach a guest device (LAN → isolated)
sh tools/allow-service.sh guest 192.168.3.105 tcp 22 24h

# List all active temporary allowances (both directions)
sh tools/allow-service.sh list

# Remove one manually (rule name shown by list)
sh tools/allow-service.sh remove allow_guest_lan_192_168_1_100_443_tcp
sh tools/allow-service.sh remove allow_lan_guest_192_168_3_105_22_tcp
```

```
Usage: allow-service.sh <network> <dest-ip> <proto> <port> <duration> [dest-zone]

  network     UCI interface name (e.g. guest, untrusted)
  dest-ip     IPv4 or IPv6 destination address
  proto       tcp or udp
  duration    1h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 2d, 7d, 30d — auto-removed via cron, survives reboots
  dest-zone   lan = create an isolated→LAN rule; omit for LAN→isolated (default)
```

Rule names follow the pattern:
- `allow_<network>_lan_<ip>_<port>_<proto>` — isolated→LAN rules
- `allow_lan_<network>_<ip>_<port>_<proto>` — LAN→isolated rules

Rules are stored in UCI (persist across reboots). If the router reboots after the scheduled removal time has passed, remove the rule manually with `sh tools/allow-service.sh list` then `remove`.

### Expose a port

Forward a specific port from an isolated network to a LAN host — useful for gaming sessions or temporary server access.

```sh
# Permanent
sh tools/expose-port.sh guest 27015 192.168.1.50

# Auto-remove after 2 hours
sh tools/expose-port.sh guest 27015 192.168.1.50 2h

# With protocol and custom name
sh tools/expose-port.sh guest 25565 192.168.1.50 3h tcp minecraft
```

```
Arguments: <src-zone> <port> <dest-ip> [duration] [proto] [name]

  duration   30m, 2h, 1h30m — auto-removed via cron, survives reboots
  proto      tcp, udp, or "tcp udp" (default)
  name       label for the rule (default: expose-<zone>-<port>)
```

Guests connect to the router's zone IP (e.g. `192.168.3.1:27015`) — the router NATs the connection to the LAN host.

### Remove an exposed port

```sh
sh tools/unexpose-port.sh expose-guest-27015

# Or use the custom name
sh tools/unexpose-port.sh minecraft
```

Also cancels any scheduled cron removal.

### Rotate password

Generate a new random password, apply it immediately, and print a QR code. Password rotation is never scheduled automatically; use this only when you intentionally need to replace the current WiFi password.

```sh
sh tools/rotate-password.sh configs/guest.conf
```

Updates the config file in place, applies the new key to the active WiFi network, and disconnects clients still using the old password. When `JOIN_APPROVAL=yes`, labeled approved devices stay approved; unlabeled approvals, pending requests, and denied requests are cleared.

The same action is available from the status dashboard when `ROTATE_PASSWORD=yes` is set. The dashboard button calls `/cgi-bin/rotate-password` (POST only, CSRF-checked), which generates a new password, applies it live via hostapd without reloading WiFi, syncs the config file on disk, and sends a push notification containing the new password. The dashboard page refreshes automatically so the updated QR code is visible immediately.

> The dashboard rotation does **not** regenerate the guest-info HTML page — run `sh tools/guest-info.sh configs/<iface>.conf` manually to update it if you use that page.

The QR code shown in the dashboard is served as an SVG by `/cgi-bin/qr?net=<iface>` (requires `qrencode`). This endpoint returns `403` for networks where `SHOW_QR=no` or for the `untrusted` network.

### Guest info page

Generate a LAN-accessible webpage with the network name, password, and QR code.

```sh
sh tools/guest-info.sh configs/guest.conf
# → http://192.168.1.1/net/guest.html  (LAN only)
```

The page is served by the router's built-in web server (uhttpd). Isolated network zones have `INPUT=REJECT`, so guests and IoT devices cannot access it — only LAN devices can.

Re-run after rotating the password to update the page.

## Adding a new network

1. Copy an example: `cp configs/guest.conf.example configs/mynetwork.conf`
2. Set `IFACE`, `SSID`, `SUBNET`, `WIFI_KEY` — ensure the subnet doesn't overlap with existing networks
3. Run `sh install.sh configs/mynetwork.conf`

## Notes

- **Rate limiting** uses `nft limit rate` (drop) rather than `tc tbf` — `kmod-sched-core` is not packaged on all platforms. Packets exceeding the cap are dropped rather than queued; for IoT and guest traffic this is acceptable.
- **Traffic counters** reset on `fw4 reload` (which happens on every `install.sh` run). For persistent usage stats, consider `vnstat`.
- **Re-running** `install.sh` on an existing network is safe — it updates all settings cleanly.
- **Wireless sections** are created automatically if they don't exist in UCI. `WIFI_UCI` can be set to reuse a pre-existing UCI wireless section with a different name than `IFACE` — useful when migrating an existing setup; omit it for new networks.
- **DEVICE_CONTROL requires JOIN_APPROVAL** — without join approval, device IPs are never recorded and the per-device nft rules can't be generated. Set both in the config and re-run `install.sh`.
- **DHCP pool** is fixed at `.100`–`.249` (150 addresses) with a 12-hour lease time. To change these, edit the UCI directly after install: `uci set dhcp.<iface>.start=100`, `uci set dhcp.<iface>.limit=150`, `uci set dhcp.<iface>.leasetime=12h`, then `uci commit dhcp && /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart`.
- **Join history** is stored in `/etc/extra-networks/<iface>-join-history` as a tab-delimited file and is included in `sysupgrade.conf` — it survives reboots and normal OpenWrt upgrades. `JOIN_HISTORY_RETENTION` controls how long entries are kept (default 90 days).
